	<h1>Welcome to the Head First Lounge</h1>

Stop in to sample the eclectic offering of elixirs, teas, and coffees, or, stay a bit longer and enjoy the multicultural culinary menu that combines a harmony of taste, texture, and color with the best in fresh and healthy ingredients.</p>

	<p>During your stay at the lounge, you'll enjoy a smooth mixture of ambient and mystic sounds, filling the lounge and adding an extra dimension to your dining experience. The decor surrounds you with the relaxing sentiments of sights from eras past. And, don't forget, the lounge offers free wireless access to the Internet, so bring your laptop.</p>
